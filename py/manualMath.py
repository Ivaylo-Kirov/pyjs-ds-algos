# Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

# Example 1:

# Input: a = 1, b = 2
# Output: 3
# Example 2:

# Input: a = -2, b = 3
# Output: 1

    # first idea is maybe using bits
    # 1 is 01
    # 2 is 10
    # total is 11 which is 3

    # while a and b
    # if a | b
    # giving up, too obscure
